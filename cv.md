## About Me:

 As a student, I participated in the organization of the ["StartUP HEART"](адрес "https://startupheart.by/") startup project in the direction of "Investors", where I was engaged in the search for investors and attracting investments in the project. I also did an internship at the Industrial Park "Great Stone" as a project manager specialist. During my 5th year at the university, I worked at ArtisMedia as a project manager and deputy head of the technical department.

 I am currently working on a startup called Unleashy. I am responsible for the application landing page, and I am also responsible for app's localization and ASO promotion.

 I want to move from project management to web development, as it is very interesting to create something of my own in practice and see the result. While working as a project manager in a web studio, I watched the work of programmers every day and realized that I also really want to be directly involved in the creation of the site and applications.

 Perfectionist by nature, I take tasks seriously, always try to do it as efficiently and conscientiously as possible. Working as a project manager gave me invaluable experience in communicating with the team and customers.
I have good communication and business writing skills.

 I am convinced that it is always necessary to develop and learn something new. I am sure that my diligence and persistence will help me become an excellent front-end developer in the future.
